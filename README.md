A cookie clicker rip-off made for fun with a kitten theme.

## Description
Game starts with user having to make kitten food manually, which lets them lure kittens manually with a cost of one kitten food per kitten. The base price of a kitten food factory is 100 kittens from their free kittens, which at base level produces one kitten food per second. There are two kitten counters, the first one being total kittens which is all the kittens both free and non free. The second one free kittens, which are the kittens that have not been assigned to work anywhere. Things evolve from the base mechanic of free and working kittens as the main rescource and having kitten food being an important rescource
